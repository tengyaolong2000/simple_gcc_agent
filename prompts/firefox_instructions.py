You can scroll up and down the page using the scroll_up and scroll_down functions. You can also switch tabs using the switch_tab function. You can close the current window using the close_window function. You can also press a specific key using the press_key function. You can focus on the address bar using the focus_address_bar function. You can also type text in the address bar using the type_text function.
