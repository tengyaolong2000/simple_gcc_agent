### 1. What is the 'edg simon drama'?
Simon, known as S1Mon, is a Taiwanese professional Valorant player who joined Edward Gaming (EDG) in 2023. He contributed to significant tournament wins, including the 2024 VCT China League annual championship and the 2024 Valorant Global Championship.
However, in April 2024, the EDG Valorant team sidelined Simon officially due to issues with his attitude, which was publicly confirmed by EDG management. It was reported Simon showed signs of giving up and throwing tantrums, causing friction within the team. This decision led to public statements from EDG players and management, creating discussion and trending topics on multiple platforms. Some fans sympathized with Simon's mental pressure, while others supported the club's management approach.

### 2. Detailed summary:
- Simon started his professional career in 2023 and quickly rose as a skilled player known for clutch plays and critical performances.
- Despite his skill, his attitude and internal team dynamics led to tensions.
- On April 14, 2024, EDG announced Simon's departure from the team after friendly negotiations.
- The drama drew widespread attention in the esports community, with official statements from both EDG players and management.
- The manager cited attitude problems as the primary reason for the roster change.

### 3. My opinion:
Esports is a highly competitive field where skill alone isn't always enough; teamwork, attitude, and professionalism are crucial for long-term success. While Simon's talent is undeniable, managing one's attitude and mental resilience is essential in a team environment. The club's decision to sideline him, based on attitude issues, appears to be a necessary move to maintain team harmony and competitive performance. However, it's important that young players like Simon receive proper support to handle the pressures of professional play. This incident highlights the challenges young esports talents face and underlines the need for mental health awareness and professional development alongside gameplay skills.
